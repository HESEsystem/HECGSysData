1,5,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,4,The provided human error modes were helpful with including specific ‘If When Then’ descriptions of rule encodings. The arrows were fairly easy to use and implement. The download diagram png and clear all buttons were convenient.,The various human error mode and schemata boxes were not size adjustable and did not conform to the amount of text input. Text could not be edited afterward initial input. The general human error scenarios were limited without an option to add custom general scenarios. ,
2,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,4,"The recent ability to add multiple arrows, the ability to quickly export pngs, and the support it gives you to correctly construct human error boxes are very helpful","No ability to scale boxes or at least have it scale as you add more text, meaning that boxes quickly have writing overflow. There is also not enough room to put multiple boxes in events, as sometimes occurred in class examples. Also, no ability to delete single element ",
3,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,"Drag and drop function and not having to write as much as error modes are already
written
",Arrows are a little hard to grab and text box for resulting defect and location is too small,
4,4,3,3,4,4,4,3,4,3,I like the clear all button. The tutorial is nice.,"I found it a bit annoying you couldn’t rotate arrows. I also would have liked the to be able to delete things rather than throw them off the screen. Also, if you hit cancel it still creates a blank box for whatever error mode you clicked on.",
5,5,4,4,4,4,4,5,4,2,I like that for some error modes the program automatically fills out the general scenario ,The fact that you can’t change the text of the bubbles after they spawn ,
6,4,4,4,4,4,3,5,5,3,"Making diagrams like this is a pain, and using this system is a lot easier to make these specfic types of diagrams then using any other tool. The built-in element formats are really helpful and save a lot of time when making EPS diagrams","Can’t delete elements;  Can’t change element text after creating them; Element text sometimes escapes the element’s boundaries;  Missing many error modes
",
7,2,4,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,"Thought, it was di?icult for figuring out the way to use it, however after learning the tool, it is much faster than manually drawing. ; The tutorial section gave some glimpse of how to operate the tool and its system","No enough details in the tutorial, perhaps some hovering e?ect on the buttons or some icons would guide user for better understanding of the tool. ; There is no delete or undo feature, so in the beginning multiple tries and errors were made. ; Later figured out that to delete something we just need to hide in behind the canvas. An 
early instruction on this would be extremely helpful.",
8,3,3,4,4,4,3,5,5,4,Simple straightforward tool that doesn’t have a huge learning curve to it.,No option to delete graphical elements which is annoying when paired with not being able to preview what a created graphical element will look like after creation.,
9,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,Easy to learn how to use,"Inconsistent, Doesn't always work",
10,4,1,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,It Is easy to use and it gives clean and concise diagram in less time.,"Clear all, I didn’t like the option clear all, there should be an option of undo or go back or delete single entity instead of clear all. ",
11,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,2,Graph blocks were easy to use ; Easy to drag and move graph blocks,Connections were hard to move and resize ; Limited number of connections ,
12,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,4,3,Structured error Analysis; Cognitive mapping; Error prevention,Complexity ; Open to interpretatio ,
13,5,3,4,4,3,5,5,1,3,"The system is incredibly easy to use, has simple features and does not clutter the screen. ","The most glaring negative aspect is that not all of the HEM’s are present, the images are exported at very low quality as well. ",
14,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,4,4,Drag and drop components are very nice to have. ,I want to be able to delete components rather than only being able to clear the entire diagram.,
15,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,5,3,"Much easier for creating human error modes; Since the tool is targeted for EPS, it is clearer what is needed to create an EPS diagram than if I was hand making them; Overall saved me time","Cannot delete shapes/lines; Cannot modify text;  Cannot change shapes size, making it so you cannot fit everything you want appropriate in 
a diagram",
16,5,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,How it has HEMS premade likepost completion error and stuff ,I think may be not having an option to undo things or delete specific selected item ,
17,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,It makes it a lot quicker and easier to analyze human errors compared to doing everything by hand. The built-in structures save a lot of time by already having a description of the error. ,"Only some of the potentially relevant human error modes are included in the system. Additionally, there are some issues with the implementation of the software. This arrow structure often comes apart when I am trying to adjust the source of an arrow;  Additionally, the Strong-but-now-wrong structure displays the Rule X box as Rule A ",
18,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,I liked that arrows could be moved on each end,"Not being able to edit text from boxes after they were created (and not being able to
highlight the text to copy and paste them with changes either)","Not being able to edit text from boxes after they were created (and not being able to

19,2,3,3,4,3,3,5,4,4,"Components were simple and easy to locate. Moving components and connecting them
was intuitive","I couldn’t find a way to edit or delete components. I also couldn’t find a way to format
text, including the indented IF WHEN THEN format in EPS analysis","I couldn’t find a way to edit or delete components. I also couldn’t find a way to format

20,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,5,I like that it does a lot of the tedious work for me like drawing the shapes and showing the if-when-then model for each error-prone scenario ,Not being able to modify elements after they’ve been created ,Not being able to modify elements after they’ve been created 
21,3,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,2,"Easy to use, simple UI ","It was kind of annoying that you have to click exactly on the item to move it, even if you are only just a few pixels off ; Cancelling the prompt still adds the blank graphic to the screen ; You cannot delete a singular item without clearing the entire page ","It was kind of annoying that you have to click exactly on the item to move it, even if you are only just a few pixels off ; Cancelling the prompt still adds the blank graphic to the screen ; You cannot delete a singular item without clearing the entire page "
22,5,2,3,3,2,2,5,5,3,Makes it much easier to draw diagrams. Would always use this over pen and paper.,"It can be difficult to drag things where you want them to go. It also needs a delete button, it is very frustrating that you can’t delete individual parts.","It can be difficult to drag things where you want them to go.

23,5,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,4,The system was easy to use after watching the live demo. The features are clear. ,The system was a little inconvenient to use because any mistakes had to be moved off screen rather than being able to just undo actions. ,The system was a little inconvenient to use because any mistakes had to be moved off screen rather than being able to just undo actions. 
24,3,3,4,N/A,4,4,4,3,3,It likely would save time when creating EPSs for many defects/scenarios;  It has potential if the kinks are worked out,No delete function;  Can’t actually cancel a module after clicking on it;  Connectors with multiple arrows can separate; Doesn’t support some HEMs; Fixed size canvas,No delete function;  Can’t actually cancel a module after clicking on it;  Connectors with multiple arrows can separate; Doesn’t support some HEMs; Fixed size canvas
25,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,"The EPS tool made drawing Causal Mechanism Graphs quick and clean.I really liked
that I could drag-and-drop nodes, label them clearly, and connect arrows without
worrying about messy layouts.It saved a lot of time compared to manual drawing, and I
could easily edit or move items when I changed my mind.The interface felt simple and
consistent, so I didn’t need any help to figure it out.Overall, it helped me focus on
thinking about the causes of errors instead of fighting with formatting","Sometimes the layout jumped around when I added new nodes, and I had to reposition
them manually.There’s no grid-snap or alignment feature, so keeping things neat took
extra effort.It also doesn’t let you duplicate a node or edge easily, which would save
time when several CMGs have similar structures.Finally, the export image quality could
be a bit higher for presentations.These are minor issues, but fixing them would make
the tool even smoother to use.","Sometimes the layout jumped around when I added new nodes, and I had to reposition

26,4,2,3,2,4,4,4,5,4,"It was certainly much faster to complete the diagram with it that without it, and it did provide some structural help in setting it up.","If you messed up you have to delete everything and restart, you can’t delete individual components, there is no help or examples on how the various diagrams should look. Also the clicking and dragging is very finicky.","If you messed up you have to delete everything and restart, you can’t delete individual components, there is no help or examples on how the various diagrams should look.

27,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,Ease of creating Causal Mechanism Graphs; Popups direct user well; Easy to use tool,"User interface is lacking;  Prompts are a bit hard to understand sometimes; If you click an HEM, then click cancel, it still draws to the canvas","User interface is lacking;  Prompts are a bit hard to understand sometimes; If you click an HEM, then click cancel, it still draws to the canvas"
28,1,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,2,Works quickly ,"Difficult to understand, lacks basic useful functionality, tutorial unhelpful, user interface not appealing.It took me at least ten minutes when I could have drawn this by hand in a few minutes.

31,2,4,4,4,4,3,4,5,3,It was very easy to connect different parts of the diagram. ,Defect/location form you coudlnt write very much in them without the formatting overlapping with each other; Strong-but-now-Wrong rule has two rule A’s and no Rule X; Not being able to delete stuff was annoying I wish that was a feature (even though you can  just drag what you arent using off screen),Defect/location form you coudlnt write very much in them without the formatting overlapping with each other; Strong-but-now-Wrong rule has two rule A’s and no Rule X; Not being able to delete stuff was annoying I wish that was a feature (even though you can  just drag what you arent using off screen)

35,5,4,4,4,3,4,5,5,4,Obviously I would say the ability to create/construct a CMG graph so quickly and easily is a major plus. Not having to draw or construct any of the shapes myself is greatly time saving.,"I think it would be very helpful to include some sort of delete function, maybe just including backspace key functionality and cntrl-z. I would also say adding more control over the shapes, like being able to shrink them would be great.","I think it would be very helpful to include some sort of delete function, maybe just including backspace key functionality and cntrl-z.

40,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,4,The use of templates for human error modes is helpful.,"The system doesn’t include all human error modes. There isn’t a way to undo/redo or to  delete individual objects. The space is too small for complex graphs, with no apparent way  to increase the size. Objects don’t resize for text to fit inside them. Connectors don’t snap to  objects.

41,5,4,4,4,4,4,5,3,4,The scenario definitions are included. The tutorial includes an example screenshot.

It saves a lot of time once you get the hang of it.  ,"Creating an accurate graph without experience is difficult, and an example graph is necessary to get it right. I found myself using a separate text document to write out the text I would enter in the popups. This made creating the graphs very quick. The graph resolution and font size is a little too low for enlarging to fill a slide for presentation, it ends up blurry.
