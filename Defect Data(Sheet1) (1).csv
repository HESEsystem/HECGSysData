1,2/12/2025,"String should be printed in reverse order. String is parsed character by character in reverse order while string[i] character is printed. Conditional is initialized as (i=string.length() - 1, i $<$ string.length(), i--)","When parsing arrays or strings as arrays, the most common way is to parse from the start of the string or array to the end with the for loop conditional (i=0, i<string.length(), i++). When reverse parsing, i must be set to the length of the string or array – 1, with the conditional that i $>$= 0, and with i decrementing by 1.",Applying “strong-but-now-wrong” rule
2,2/13/2025,"Initially adopted a push model to run tests real time at the time the event was received. After increasing test volume, scheduling caused hotspots and oversaturation of test agent system resources resulting in test failures. Refactored to use of local queueing with N test worker services to evenly space testing and avoid overloading test agents.","The push model led to uneven resource consumption, with bursts of tests overwhelming test agents. As test volume increased, resource contention caused failures. The root cause was the lack of a controlled scheduling mechanism to distribute tests more evenly. The issue was resolved by implementing local queueing with worker services to regulate test execution.",Applying “strong-but-now-wrong” rule
3,2/12/2025,"While parsing through a string, each character should be checked to see if it matches a given character and if it is the given nth instance of that character in the string. If it is the correct instance of the correct character, the character ‘0’ should be printed, otherwise the original character should be printed. In the case where the character did not match and the case where the character matched the given character and instance the behavior was correct. The case where the character matched but the instance did not match was neglected.","When reviewing the design of one’s own work, N conditions = 3 : character and instance matches, character matches and instance does not match, and character does not match. The conditions reviewed were the first and third scenario: n=2 $<$ N=3 conditions were reviewed.",Biased review

5,1/31/2025,"When grading a programming assignment, I wrote a shell script to display everyone's write-up file one after another in the terminal. However, some students put their write-up in a sub directory, and thus the script would not work in this case.",This is an example of biased review because I did not take into account the possible case of the write-up file not being located in the repo's root directory.,Biased review

My program did not track a players role properly, allowing for a player to take multiple roles",I was focused on making sure a player could take a role and did not make sure they were prevented from taking additional roles. Fixed the error by including a check to make sure player can only have 1 role,Confirmation bias
7,2/9/2025,EC2 test agents (t4g.nano) began failing to report testing result metrics due to overloaded CPU and memory utilization resulting in inability to complete tests within the designated timeframe. Upgrade to larger instance size necessary to restore operation.,"The selected EC2 instance type (t4g.nano) did not have sufficient resources to handle the workload, leading to performance degradation and failed test executions. This issue was likely caused by underestimating resource requirements or not performing adequate load testing before deployment.",Difficulties with exponential developments
8,2/2/2025,"When comparing Integers in Java, == was used instead of .equals, resulting in a false boolean value even when the numeric values of the Integers was the same.",I didn’t know that Java uses caching for Integer values between -128 and 127 and creates new references for Integers outside of that range. So comparing Integers withing that range with == will reference the same value and return true but using == between to equally numeric Integers outside that range will return false.,Lack of knowledge

17,2/6/2025,"In Java, using the system line separator leads to undefined behavior dependent on the system since the line separator is represented by “\r\n” on Windows and “\n” on UNIX systems. This is in the documentation. Parsing such code based on line separators can be undefined in certain settings such as with files containing new line characters “\n”.",Assumed that the behavior in which the system line separator which worked on Windows would extend to other development environments as well when later investigation into the documentation revealed otherwise.,Rule encoding deficiencies
18,2/10/2025,Overlooked addition of required IAM permissions when deploying new Bedrock testing to test agents using AWS CDK.,"The required IAM permissions were not included in the AWS CDK deployment, leading to permission failures on the EC2 test agents when interacting with the Bedrock API.

When performing the rotation node Y’s parent was set as node X’s parent, but node X’s parent’s child was not replaced.","When working with nodes X and Y, the most salient references that must be updated are references stemming from nodes X and Y. Therefore node X’s parent is correctly set to node Y, node Y’s left child is set to node X, and node Y’s parent is set to node X’s parent, but node Y’s child is not updated.",Selectivity
20,2/9/2025,"In C. For an assignment making a terminal shell. I Didn't pass the entirety of the main() functions argv into the global variable I created (rather skipping the 0th index for what I thought would be easier handling), causing issues when implementing translating $# into number of arguments a user gave for the shell session. This made it difficult to tell if I was running my shell commands on a script or from stdin (the terminal), both of which handle translating $# slightly differently.","I was thinking by ignoring argv[0] and not passing it into my global variable that it would make it easier to create several different commands pertaining to my shell implementing script handling. However, I had not considered how I would be able to check if my shell commands were running from a script or stdin, or how I would handle implementing $# translation if it was running in stdin, rather than a script. This assignments main purpose was to add in script handling, so most of my attention went to implementing scripts correctly, leading me to not consider how my design would work for stdin, which I had focused on more in past assignments",Selectivity
21,12/22/2024,"While parsing an integer array nums, true should be returned if there are any duplicates. A duplicate boolean was set to the value of the current int of the array and checked if it existed in a hashmap of all previous ints of the array. Instead of returning when the condition became true, each value of the array was parsed before the true condition of the last value of the array was returned.","The logic of setting a boolean to the value of the check between the current int and all previous ints was correct, the step of returning early when that boolean was true was forgotten.",Rule encoding deficiencies

23,1/14/2025,"In the Magic Trees assignment, I had a yCount variable meant to count the number of ‘Y’s printed in the last line containing Y’s. The variable ended up equaling the actual Y count / 2, and logic was built around it to account for that, but future logic tried to use the variable as if it was accurately set to the actual Y count.","The variable yCount did not actually accurately count Y’s, but gave the impression of doing so due to the variable name. This could also correlate with a mode similar to ‘Omissions following interruption’ and ‘Forgetting something has been done’ as something like ‘Misinterpreting something that has been done’.",Perceptual confusion
24,1/14/2025,"In the Magic Trees assignment, when printing the number of spaces, depending on the line, the total spaces would be correct or too many, depending on the pattern needed in the current line.","The number of spaces needed per line depended on the line number and its reverse log 2 base. The reverse exponential factor along with variations in patters of spaces, slashes (\, /) and Y’s led to inconsistent applications of overarching logic when printing.",Difficulties with exponential developments
