1,2/12/2025,"String should be printed in reverse order. String is parsed character by character in reverse order while string[i] character is printed. Conditional is initialized as (i=string.length() - 1, i $<$ string.length(), i--)","When parsing arrays or strings as arrays, the most common way is to parse from the start of the string or array to the end with the for loop conditional (i=0, i<string.length(), i++). When reverse parsing, i must be set to the length of the string or array – 1, with the conditional that i $>$= 0, and with i decrementing by 1.",Applying “strong-but-now-wrong” rule,,
2,2/13/2025,"Initially adopted a push model to run tests real time at the time the event was received. After increasing test volume, scheduling caused hotspots and oversaturation of test agent system resources resulting in test failures. Refactored to use of local queueing with N test worker services to evenly space testing and avoid overloading test agents.","The push model led to uneven resource consumption, with bursts of tests overwhelming test agents. As test volume increased, resource contention caused failures. The root cause was the lack of a controlled scheduling mechanism to distribute tests more evenly. The issue was resolved by implementing local queueing with worker services to regulate test execution.",Applying “strong-but-now-wrong” rule,,
3,2/12/2025,"While parsing through a string, each character should be checked to see if it matches a given character and if it is the given nth instance of that character in the string. If it is the correct instance of the correct character, the character ‘0’ should be printed, otherwise the original character should be printed. In the case where the character did not match and the case where the character matched the given character and instance the behavior was correct. The case where the character matched but the instance did not match was neglected.","When reviewing the design of one’s own work, N conditions = 3 : character and instance matches, character matches and instance does not match, and character does not match.

But evidently they did, and it is an example of an error causing a fault that did not immediately lead to a failure. The error itself is in my opinion an example of a lack of knowledge: I did not know how permanent the HTML tags were, and if they would be changed or not by updates, as I have no knowledge of the eternal workings of the websites I am creating extensions for in my personal project.",Lack of knowledge,,
181,N/A,Distracted by working on too many separate functions,"While doing a class assignment in a brand new topic, I started trying multiple things to test out the functionality of what I was learning (buffer overflow attacks). When I came back I started toflesh out one of these things and was surprised when I was getting unexpected outputs. I eventually realized that my unfinished framework from earlier was breaking things down the line, as it was never meant to be finalized. This is an example of an omission following an interruption: the time I took away from the computer caused me to forget that there were other aspects of the attack that were unfinished, and so I omitted the lines that would have caused the program to run correctly.",Omissions following interruptions,,
182,N/A,The first example is an error I made on an assignment where I was to compare a list of runtimes and sort them in order from least (fastest) to greatest (slowest). The submission was to be a pdf constructed using LaTex. I mistakenly used greater than or equal to symbol ( ? ) instead of the correct greater than symbol ( < ).,I believe this occurred during the coding and review stage because I used the wrong symbol when writing the LaTex code and failed to recognize my mistake when reviewing my answers in the pdf output and at the skill-based performance level. I am highly confident that this error was the result of Perceptual confusions. ? looks very similar to < so used it instead.,Perceptual confusions,,
183,N/A,The second example is an error I made on an assignment where I was to create a function that takes in an array of items in a set and an array of relations in a set and determines if the set is transitive. Return true if it is false if it’s not. The assignment description gave a few examples of correct and incorrect inputs but didn’t show any examples of edge cases. I forgot to include the null set edge case leading to the function returning false instead of true.,I believe this occurred during the coding stage and at the knowledge-based performance level. I am highly confident that this error was the result of Bias Review. The instructions only contained examples of true and false sets so I focused on getting those to work. Once they returned the proper values for all of the sets I assumed I had successfully covered all the cases which led to me skipping over the null set edge case.,Biased review,,
184,N/A,"Another example is I was working on a homework assignment with multiple problems. The instructions stated to solve the following problem, how we were to format our answers, when the assignments was due, and at the end to write on the top of our paper if we worked alone or with a team. I forgot to put that I worked alone on the top and as a result lost a significant amount of points on the assignment.",I believe this occurred at the requirement level as I skipped a requirement and at the review level as I was focused on reviewing the answers to thequestions. I am highly confident this is a Post-Completion Error. Writing if I worked alone was the last step and it was smaller and nonessential to the main task of completing the homework.,Post-Completion Error,,
185,N/A,"Another error I personally made is on a quiz the question was “to write down a recurrence that computes a^n using divide and conquer. For example, if we are trying to compute 28, our algorithm should first compute b=24 and then return b*b. Be sure to include cases for both odd and even n.” I incremented n by -2 each recursion instead of n/2.",I believe this occurred at the coding stage as it was when I was actually writing the code that this occurred. This quiz was timed so I did not have time to review my code. I have a medium level of confidence this occurred at the knowledge-based level and is a Selectivity error. I missed the logically important information that I was supposed to use divide and conquer because I was focused on including both odd and even cases.,Selectivity,,
186,N/A,"The final error I personally made that I can remember for purposes of this project occurred when I was trying to give a runtime analysis of a program similar to binary search. I recognized it was similar to binary search and assumed the runtime was O(n log n), the runtimeof binary search. I focused on proving the runtime was O(n log n) instead of computing it from scratch which resulted in me getting the wrong runtime.",I believe this occurred at the design stage as I assumed the solution instead of working to find the best solution. I am highly confident that this occurred at the knowledge-based level and is Confirmation bias. I was trying to confirm the solution and only focusing on the psychologically stagnant information that supported that instead of the logically important information I needed to calculate the correct runtime.,Confirmation bias,,
187,N/A,The first example is from a Student who was modifying a Radix sort algorithm to sort negative numbers as well as positive numbers. The student updated all functions in Radix sort but it still wasn’t working correctly. This was because they had forgotten to add a way to separate the negative numbers from the positive numbers so the array of negative numbers was empty and all values were in the positive numbers array.,This occurred at the coding stage and I believe at the skill-based level. I am highly confident this is a Post-Completion Error as it was the smaller final step in the larger task of updating the Radix sort algorithm.,Post-Completion Error,,
188,N/A,The second example is from a Student who was working on the 247 pointer lab. The first portion of this lab is following step by step instructions provided by the teacher. This student was talking to a friend who was working on the same project and as a result skipped over a step causing the code to fail to compile.,This occurred at the coding stage and at the skill-based level. I am highly confident this is an Omission Following Interruption as the student picked up the instructions a step ahead after talking to their friend (interruption). I think this could also be Perceptual confusions as their friend was working on the same project and a few steps ahead so it’s possible they were looking at their friend's code and mistook it for theirs causing them to believe they were further along than they were.,Perceptual confusions,,
189,N/A,Another example is a Student was working on a Python truth table of XOR function in 141. The User inputs two true or false values in the form T or F and a boolean value that is the result of XORing the inputs is returned. The Student used T or F instead of true or false forBoolean values causing a compile error as they were returning a char when the program expected a boolean.,This occurred at the coding stage and the knowledge-based and skill-based levels. This could be a Lack of Knowledge Error as the student hadn’t previously used boolean types so didn’t know to use the keywords “true” and “false”. This could also be Perceptual confusions as the input is a char T or F which has the same function in this project as true or false resulting in the student using the wrong one.,Lack of knowledge,,
190,N/A,A 145 assignment asked students to create an array of integers with length size. This resulted in approximately 3-4 students students attempting to create new array in the way new instances of an object are created after learning about objects the previous week. They wrote Array a= new Array(int); instead of: int [] a = new int [size];.,This occurred at the coding stage and at the rule-based level. I believe with medium confidence this is a “Strong-but-now-wrong” Rule. Students were familiar with the creation of objects and had successfully used it multiple times in the previous week so when faced with the new rule of creating arrays they mistakenly used the familiar rule of creating objects.,Applying “strong-but-now-wrong” rule,,
191,N/A,approximately 10-12 students used getters and setters instead of constructors like directed.,This occurred at the design and coding stage as the initial design lacked constructors and they wrote code for just getters and setters instead. I believe with medium confidence this occurs at the rule-based level and is a “Strong-but-now-wrong” Rule. The stronger rule of creating getters and setters to access private variables was used instead of the newer rule of usinging constructors and setting the private variables with input from the constructor arguments.,Applying “strong-but-now-wrong” rule,,
192,N/A,The second error was using inheritance instead of encapsulation to rewrite the class; around 20-25 students did this (possibly more I should’ve counted exactly but it was a lot).,I believe this occurred at the requirements and design stage because the code varied but the key concept stayed the same. I am highly confident this is at the knowledge-based level and a Lack of Knowledge of what encapsulation is. It also could be Selectivity and the students focused on the phycologically stagnant object-oriented part instead of the logically important encapsulation part.,Lack of knowledge,,
